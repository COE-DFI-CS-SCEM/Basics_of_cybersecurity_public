# Ardiuno Cybersecurity Projects 

* <b> Password generator:</b> An Arduino-based password generator can be used to generate strong passwords for online accounts, and can be integrated with a computer or mobile device to simplify the process of creating and remembering complex passwords.

* <b> Security camera:</b> An Arduino-based security camera can be used to monitor and record activity in a home or office, and can be programmed to send alerts if motion is detected or if the camera is tampered with.

* <b> Network traffic analyzer:</b> An Arduino-based network traffic analyzer can be used to monitor and analyze network traffic for suspicious activity, such as malware or hacking attempts.

* <b> Two-factor authentication device:</b> An Arduino-based two-factor authentication device can be used to provide an additional layer of security for online accounts, by requiring a physical token in addition to a password for login.

* <b> Wireless network intrusion detector:</b> An Arduino-based wireless network intrusion detector can be used to detect and alert users to unauthorized access to a wireless network.

* <b> USB password vault:</b> An Arduino-based USB password vault can be used to securely store and retrieve passwords for multiple accounts, and can be accessed using a master password or biometric authentication.
